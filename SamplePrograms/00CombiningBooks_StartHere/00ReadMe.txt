Once you have all of the books of the Tanach transliterated you will want to combine
them into a single file. This folder contains an example program which does this. The
program is written in ICON. This language is in the public domain. Get a copy at:

https://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/

A free book describing Icon is located at:

http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/ftp/doc/lb1up.pdf

Or if you prefer, you can get a copy of Unicon because Icon is a subset of Unicon.
If this is your preference, you can get Unicon at:

http://unicon.sourceforge.net/

A free Unicon book is available at:

http://www2.cs.uidaho.edu/~jeffery/unicon/ub.pdf

The sample program in this folder is named CombineBooks01.icn. There is also a Windows
executable named CombineBooks01.exe. If you run the executable you will get a 
file named XYZ_Tanach.txt.

The best way to run this program is from a command window. This is because you will 
be able to see any messages generated by the program. In Windows 7 click the 
Start Button. Then type "Cmd.exe" to get a command window. Next use the CD command 
to navigate to the folder where this 00ReadMe.txt is located. Now you can type 
CombineBooks01.exe to run the sample program and produce the XYZ_Tanach.txt file.

If you want to look at the source code for CombineBooks01.icn, you can do so with 
NotePad. However, if you're going to do any serious programming I would recommend 
something like Gedit or TextPad. Both are free on the internet. Tip: turn on the line 
number feature in the editor. This will help you find your errors.

About Icon/Unicon:

Please download either Icon or Unicon and install it on your machine following the
instructions that come with it. This will allow you to make changes to the sample
programs.

To compile the above sample program:
 1) Open a command widow with Cmd.exe.
 2) CD to the folder/directory where CombineBooks01.icn is stored.
 3) Type "icont CombineBooks01.icn" from the command prompt.
 4) You should get an executable named "CombineBooks01.exe"

About the sample data:

Each book of the Tanach was truncated to just the first two verses. This was done to
avoid violating any copyrights or end user license agreements.

Don't worry. The CombineBooks01.icn works for any size file. And in any case we'll be
working with full versions of the Tanach very soon.

Windows vs. Linux:

You can get Icon or Unicon for both Windows or Linux. This ReadMe is written from
a Windows point of view. If you prefer Linux, you can probably run these programs
on Linux with very little difficulty. You will just have to recompile the .icn 
programs.

In the next example we'll transliterate a Tanach.
