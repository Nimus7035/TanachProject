This folder contains transliterated texts of the Hebrew Tanach. The source of
each text is not indicated. However, if you have been hard at work making your
own transliterated texts this won't matter. Just use the texts you've been
creating.

If you haven't worked through all the examples, and created your own 
transliterated texts, you can use the ones in this folder. But you'll have to 
guess which version you're working with.

I'm sorry that I have to do this, and I do apologize.

This folder also contains a program called RemoveSpaces.icn. This program can 
be used to remove the spaces from a transliterated Tanach yielding a file 
called Tanach_NoSpaces.txt. These are the files found in folder 30.

There is one caveat however. Before you remove the spaces from a 
Tanach_Lines.txt you first must eliminate all the variant readings. This is 
necessary because each text flags variant readings differently. Sometimes an
asterisk or double asterisk is the flag. Other times the text employs brackets
or braces. And of course before you remove a variant reading you'll want to 
carefully consider which reading you're removing and which you're retaining.

Of course some texts do not contain variant readings. In this case just run
RemoveSpaces.exe, and you're done.
