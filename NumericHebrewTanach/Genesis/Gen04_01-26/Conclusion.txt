Five of the texts had dominant factors of 11, 13, and 31. 
And five others had a dominant factor of 11. Eleven had the 
winning score. The difference was found in the last word of 
verse 13 which contained an extra vav.

The search by phrases technique indicated that 11 was
the number for Aleph Yod which means "where?". This is
consistent with the subject matter of the chapter in
which God asks Cain "where" is your brother.

Tanachs 04, 08, 09, 10, and 11 are confirmed as the 
authentic texts.
