This folder contains a variety of programs. The two most important are PaninScores and
SearchForPhrases. These are the two programs that are used to numerically validate the
text of the Tanach. These two programs are constantly evolving so be sure to use the
most up to date versions.

The latest version of SearchForPhrases no longer needs a separate input file. It uses the
same input file that PaninScores uses. This is made possible by the use of a new file
named SearchParms.txt. The parameters in SearchParms.txt tell SearchForPhrases what
portion(s) of the input file it should use.

You can learn what any program does by reading the comments at the top of the program.

The TanachNames.txt file contains paths to the files containing the various unverified
Tanachs. You will need to edit this file to match the paths you are using on your computer.
