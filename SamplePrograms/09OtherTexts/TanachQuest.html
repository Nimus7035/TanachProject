<FONT SIZE=4>A good many years ago (I will call this year two because
I'm trying to be vague) I became interested in the Bible codes, and
purchased some software to do some personal investigation. The first
thing I searched for, of course, was my own name. I found my name
without much difficulty, and surrounding and intersecting my name
were the names of my wives and children. </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="zxx" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<BR>
</P>
<P LANG="zxx" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<FONT SIZE=4>I was pleased with this result, and a little amazed at
how easy it had been. The ease left me a little skeptical so I
decided to do some further investigation. I searched for the name of
one of my brothers. After some attempts at guessing the correct
transliteration of his name, I obtained the desired matrix. It
contained the name of my brother along with his three children and
the name of the tiny country town that he lived in.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="zxx" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<BR>
</P>
<P LANG="zxx" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<FONT SIZE=4>I was impressed, but also seriously dismayed because try
as I might, I could not find the name of my brother's wife anywhere
in the matrix. Looking back it seems silly, but at the time this
really upset me. So I thought, &quot;You know, I really don't need to
know this stuff,&quot; and I set the software aside.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="zxx" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<BR>
</P>
<P LANG="zxx" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<FONT SIZE=4>Years passed; the kids were now grown, and I was now on
my third wife. I had been telling her about the Bible codes, and one
day on a whim I got into my old paper files and pulled out the
original matrix containing my name. I stared at it a while and then
circled the letters containing the name of my most recent wife. &quot;That
was easy,&quot; I thought, and I decided to begin dabbling in the
codes again.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="zxx" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<BR>
</P>
<P LANG="zxx" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<FONT SIZE=4>So I bought some new software (notice that I'm not
naming any companies), installed it, and did a search for my name. I
got nothing! This disturbed me greatly. Had God removed my name from
the Tanach because of my many sins? The very thought made me tremble.
Was this even possible? Can the Tanach change? I know that with God
all things are possible, but would He change the Tanach? These
questions made my head spin, and I was very upset.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="zxx" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<BR>
</P>
<P LANG="zxx" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<FONT SIZE=4>So I began to dig a little deeper. I tried searching for
just my first name using the original Equidistant Letter Sequence
(skip) from years ago. I found it with no trouble. Then I added the
first letter of my last name, and had success again. But when I added
the next letter of my last name, the search failed.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="zxx" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<BR>
</P>
<P LANG="zxx" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<FONT SIZE=4>Next I tried searching for the remainder of my last name
omitting the characters already found. Eureka! I had located the
remainder of my name. So what was the problem? If I could find the
two halves separately, why couldn't I find the whole. The answer was
actually quite simple. The Tanach I was searching on, was different
from the Tanach I had searched years before. This Tanach had an extra
letter between the first and second letters of my last name.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="zxx" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<BR>
</P>
<P LANG="zxx" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<FONT SIZE=4>Armed with this information, I located the original
software that I had used years before. I still had one old computer
that it would work on so I installed it, searched for my name, and
found it with no problem. Of course this begs the question, &quot;Which
Tanach should I be using for my searches?&quot;</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=4>Which Tanach should I be using for my searches? I
pondered the question. I supposed that if I were to make an
intelligent decision, I would have to do a character by character
comparison of the various Tanach versions that were available. I made
an unfruitful search to find software that would do this on the web.
There just didn't seem to be anything suitable out there. Could I
create something myself? I had done computer programming
professionally for most of my life, but I was retired now, and hadn't
written a line of code in years.</FONT></P>

<P LANG="zxx" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<FONT SIZE=4>I decided to give it a try, but first I had to have some
Tanachs to compare. I bought and/or download every Tanach I could get
my hands on. Then I set about to write my programs. &quot;I could
write very short simple programs to get the job done,&quot; I
reasoned. After all, how hard could it be to compare two characters?</FONT></P>

<P LANG="zxx" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<FONT SIZE=4>It was a little hard at first, but little by little my

manually, inorder to keep the programs short and simple. But as my
confidence grew so did the programs.</FONT></P>

<P LANG="zxx" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<FONT SIZE=4>After a while, I had some preliminary results. I didn't
even need a compare program to notice that some Tanachs had more
characters than others. The shortest was 1,196,921 bytes in length,

<FONT SIZE=4>Some of my Tanachs differed in as few as four places.

was that Tanachs purchased from the same (unnamed) company were
different, and the differences were in different places!</FONT></P>

day filled large rooms with raised floors. The term &quot;personal

<FONT SIZE=4>The problem with the Machine Company was that they owned
my thoughts. In order to insure a steady flow of income I had been
forced to agree that any ideas that occured to me &ndash; even those
conceived on my own time &ndash; belonged to the company. I was
supposed to write all these thoughts in a bound notebook, and
surrender them to the company when the notebook got full. If any of
my ideas became a patent, I would receive one &quot;patent point&quot;.
If I accumulated about twenty or so of these points, I could redeem
them for something tangible like a toaster, a steam iron, or a
pressure cooker.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=4>But what did any of this have to do with Ivan Panin? I
first heard of Panin from a tract published by a group in Chicago.
The tract was titled &quot;The Inspiration of the Scriptures
Scientifically Demonstrated&quot;. (Before the internet people
published their ideas on small leaflets called tracts, and gave these
out to anyone who showed an interest.) The tract went on about
patterns and numbers in Scripture, multiples of seven, and how you
could count things to determine the authenticity of the text.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=4>I was intrigued. I would like to put the biblical texts
(and Panin's ideas) to the test by writing a computer program,
submitting the texts to the program, and seeing what I could find.
But there were problems with this idea. The only computers I had
access to belonged to the Machine Company, and if I wrote any
programs, they too became the property of the company.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=4>My first attempt at resolving a variant reading involved
Genesis 8:17. There's one word in this verse that can be spelled two
different ways. I decided to write a program to help me reslove the
spelling variation. Ivan Panin had a variety of mathmatical
techniques he used to determine the authenticity of a biblical text.
Of course Ivan lived a hundred years ago. So he did his calculations
with a pencil, and his searching with his eye balls! There were some
things that he did that I just wasn't going to be able to do, but I
<I><B>could</B></I> count consonants, vowels, and words. I could
total the things that I counted, and factor the totals. I talked to
the Lord about what to do with all these numbers. He gave me the
concept of the dominant factor.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="zxx" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<BR>
</P>
<P LANG="zxx" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<FONT SIZE=4>The dominant factor is simply the one that occurs the
most often.  In my Genesis 8:17 experiment I first tried evaluating
the single verse. I calculated the numbers once for each spelling
variant. The results were disappointing. No numbers jumped off the
screen at me. It was very inconclusive.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="zxx" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<BR>
</P>
<P LANG="zxx" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<FONT SIZE=4>Then the Lord gave me more inspiration. The verse needed
to be evaluated in context. I decided to do the numbers on a complete
pericope. A pericope is a section of the Bible that pertains to a
single subject. So I worked on finding just the right range of verses
that would allow me to make an intelligent decision. It wasn't hard
to pick the verses. Nearly all Bibles have sections of text with
subject headings. I just followed the lead of my predecessors.</FONT></P>
<P LANG="zxx" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<BR>
</P>
<P LANG="zxx" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<FONT SIZE=4>This time the results were encouraging. The dominant
factor was 61. The runner up was 271. I was encouraged by these
results, but felt I needed more evidence. My intuition was that 61
and 271 had meanings. I knew what I should do. I got electronic
copies of the Strongs Lexicon and the Brown-Driver-Briggs lexicon and
computed the values of all the words. Then I sorted them in numeric
order. I thought I would simply look up the number 61, and the number
271 in the lexicon to see what they mean. The results were
disappointing to say the least. There were lots of words that totaled
61 or 271. The answer was not to be found in the lexicon. I had
wasted a few weeks of work.</FONT></P>

<P LANG="zxx" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<FONT SIZE=4>I talked to the Lord about my failure. As I sat in my
bed talking to the Lord, and thinking about the problem He gave me a
small vision. It was of a window moving across the text. As it moved
it grew larger and smaller as necessary. I understood immediately.
Just as the verse Genesis 8:17 had to be evaluated in context. The
meaning of 61 and 271 had to be determined in context too. I wrote
the moving window program, and discovered that 61 had a meaning which
