Genesis chapter 8 has it's own challenges because it has a 
variant reading in verse 17. The two possibilities are: HVCA and
HYCA. HVCA gets a score of 2 with a dominant factor of 271. HYCA
gets a score of 3 with a dominant factor of 61. So HYCA is the
winner.

As further evidence that HYCA is the correct reading 
SearchForPhrases was run on 61 and 271 with the respective
readings in the input sections. The number 61 yielded terms that
were relevant to the topic of Genesis 8:1-19 while the number
271 was less convincing.

Based on the phrases returned by the number 61, the topic of
Genesis 8:1-19 is "Going Out From The Ark".

The final three verses have no variant readings and a dominant 
factor of 7.

When the entire chapter is run as a whole with HYCA in verse 17,
the dominant factor is 7. 

The chapter is accepted as numerically verified with HYCA in
verse 17.
