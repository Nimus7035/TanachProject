SearchForPhrase.icn searches a section of the Tanach for words or phrases
that add up to a certain number. A report called PhrasesByNumberAndPlace
is produced that contains all the findings. Although this report is 
informative, it contains no English translation. You must look up the 
English translation yourself in a Hebrew Interlinear Bible. Once you've
done that, you can decide if the particular number you searched for is
the one that describes the theme of the pericope.

The concept of Number Values and Place Values is explained in 
InspirationOfTheScripturesScientificallyDemonstrated which I have
included in this folder.

Take a look at the reports named PhrasesByNumberAndPlace. Then try

Be sure to look at the ReadMe in the folder CreateNewSection. It contains
a good deal of important information.
