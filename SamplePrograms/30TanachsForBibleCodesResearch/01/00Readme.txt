This Tanach has been removed because it contains variant readings. 
The variant readings will need to be removed before this Tanach is
useful for Bible Codes research.

The variant readings cannot be removed arbitrarily. The correct
reading must be determined by careful numerical analysis. This must
be done for the entire Torah and later for the entire Tanach. A
piecemeal approach will not work.
