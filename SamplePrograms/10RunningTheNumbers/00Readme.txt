This folder and the next folder contain the heart of what this Tanach
project is all about. The idea is that by running PaninScoresBySection.icn
and SearchForPhrase.icn we can make a value judgement about which of two
variant readings is the original reading.

To get good numbers you must run the program on a pericope. A pericope is
a section of the Bible that pertains to a particular topic or subject. Most
Bibles contain section headings to indicate the pericopes. These should work
most of the time, but you may have to do some experimentation before you get
it right.

I've included a document named TanachQuest.html that gives a little 
background on the above process. It's in the folder named "09OtherTexts".

For now you might just want to look at the reports I've included, and look
at the ReadMe files in the next folder, 11DoubleCheckingTheFactors. Later 
you can come back here, and try running PaninScoresBySection.icn. 

With patience and a little study, it will all start to make sense.

The concept of Number Values and Place Values is explained in 
InspirationOfTheScripturesScientificallyDemonstrated which I have
included in this folder.

As usual, the number of verses in 00_Tanach.con.txt is severely limited. This
was done to avoid problems with copyrights and EULAs. However, if you did the
sample exercise in 02TransliteratingUnicodeText you should already have a 
complete copy of the WLC Tanach. Just copy it to this folder, and rename it 
to OO_Tanach.con.txt. Then you'll have enough verses to keep you busy for a while!
