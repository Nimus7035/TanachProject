What's in this folder? This folder contains the "apparatus". The apparatus is a
series of reports the purpose of which is to demonstrate how a particular
textual decision was made.

For the most part the textual decision being made is the choice between one
textual variant and another. Occasionally there may be a third variant. 
Sometimes the choice is a question of whether a particular word, phrase, or
verse is actually in the Tanach. Questions of word order may also be 
addressed. The programs and principles of the Tanach Project can be used to 
help make an intelligent decision in each circumstance.

Let's take a moment to look at the sample report names. First notice that each
of the report names starts with "00185". This number is the number of the 
first verse in the section of the Tanach that was processed. Verse number
00185 is Genesis 8:1. Genesis 1:1 is verse 00001, and 2 Chronicles 36:23 is
approximately verse 23213. The number is approximate because different
versions of the Tanach have different numbers of verses.

The purpose of this number is to "help" make the report names unique -- 
keeping in mind that because some Tanachs have more verses than others, the 
possibility of of a conflict always exists.

Next notice that each of the report names contains a lower case letter in the
sixth position. These letters help quickly distinguish the purpose of the file. 
The "a" file is the input to PaninScoresBySection.exe. The "b" file is the 
output from that same program. The "c" file is the input to 
SearchForPhrase.exe. The "d" file is the output from that same program.

Codicil:

The above information holds true for now, but when you get to the production
programs, you'll find that things have been simplified a bit.
