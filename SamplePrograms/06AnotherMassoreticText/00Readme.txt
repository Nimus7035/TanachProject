This folder will contain programs for reformatting the Masoretic text which
is available from Karaite-Korner at the following URL:

http://www.karaite-korner.org/downloads/tanach.zip

Working with this text is much easier than some of the others because there 
is no need to save multiple web pages and then reformat them and piece 
them all together.

The zip file contains tanach2.0.doc. You will need to open this file with Libre 
Office Writer, and then save it in one of the encoded text formats. Since I 
haven't gotten to this text yet, I don't know which encoding I will recommend.
