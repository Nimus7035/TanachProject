This version of the Masoretic text has "Full" spelling.
With full spelling the words have extra Vavs Yods Hes and
Alephs which makes the words easier for new readers to 
read. Full spelling is a fairly recent phenomena. The 
extra letters are not considered inspired, and thus this
version is probably not a good candidate for analysis by
numerical means.
