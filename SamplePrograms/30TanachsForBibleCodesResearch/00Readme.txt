The Tanachs in this section have had all the spaces and punctuation 
removed to facilitate "Bible Codes" research. The transliteration scheme 
is as follows:

A Aleph
B Beth
G Gimel
D Daleth
H He
V Vav
Z Zayin
X Heth
+ Teth
Y Yod
K Kaph
L Lamed
M Mem
N Nun
$ Samek
@ Ayin
P Pe
C Tsade
Q Qoph
R Resh
S Sin/Shin
T Tav

If you are planning to use any of these Tanachs with a commercial Bible
Codes program, please be aware that each commercial package employs
a different transliteration scheme. The Computronics scheme is very 
similar to the one above. The Research Systems scheme is very different, 
but can be displayed with the Elronet.ttf font. Bible Search Pro is probably
not worth pursing because it is no longer supported, but needless to say
it has its own transliteration scheme.

In any case you will need to alter the encoding scheme if you use any of
these Tanachs with your favorite Bible Codes program. You can transliterate
any of these Tanachs using Translit01.icn from folder 01 by just modifying the
translate table. 

Of course you could always roll your own Bible Codes program if you feel 
ambitious. Then you could use any encoding scheme you like. :-)

There is one other problem with using these Tanachs in a commercial program.
Just transliterating the letters and substituting your Tanach for their's will
work, but when you check the surface text, you'll be off by a few 
characters. This is because the Tanach that you just substituted contains a 
different number of characters than the Tanach that the software came with.

The above problem can be addressed by rebuilding an index in each package. 
I know how to do this, but don't plan to tackle the problem until I at least finish
the complete Torah. And given the fact that my health is rapidly failing, 
I don't count on this ever getting done.

Perhaps you will be the person who completes this project after I'm gone.
Talk to the Lord about it!
