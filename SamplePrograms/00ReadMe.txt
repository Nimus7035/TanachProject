Welcome to the Tanach Project!

The Tanach is the Jewish Bible. Christians call it the Old Testament. The goal of the Tanach Project is to discover the Hebrew text of the original Tanach using numerical means.

This folder, SamplePrograms, sets forth the project in a step by step tutorial fashion. Work your way through the examples, and you will soon have a grasp of all the concepts. If you're intrigued by what you see, you might even want to try your hand at resolving a few variant reading. This is your invitation. Come join us.

------------------------------------------------

I wanted to wait until the project was much further along before releasing it into the public domain. Alas, my health is rapidly failing. If I wait too long, this work may never see the light of day. So I'm releasing it in its current state with the intention of continuing to refine and expand it.

This is God's project not mine. Once I'm gone someone else will take up His work. Perhaps you will be that someone.

To God be the glory! 1 Corinthians 10:31
